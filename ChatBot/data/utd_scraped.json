    "content": "Jindal Home > About the Jindal School of Management > Message from the Dean Message from the Dean About Dean’s Message Naveen Jindal Leadership Rankings Outcomes Community Engagement Conferences Competitions Contacts Dean Hasan Pirkul Welcome to The University of Texas at Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management We are in the middle of another exciting and busy fall semester at the Naveen Jindal School of Management. I am excited to share with you the “big” news; on October 8th we broke ground for our third building. I am pleased to announce that we have designed a beautiful new facility that is going to contain state-of-the-art classrooms, labs and lecture studios. It will house our undergraduate programs as well as our executive education operations. It has many indoor and outdoor spaces for our students, faculty and staff to relax and interact. The building is planned to be 127,000 sq. ft. When completed in late spring 2026, we will have a total of nearly half a million square feet of world class facilities dedicated to our School. This year’s Scholarship Breakfast, the Jindal School’s largest fundraiser, followed the groundbreaking by one day and was a big success. We raised more than $120,000 for student scholarships and were treated to a presentation by one of the Jindal School’s distinguished alumni, Dr. Sulman Ahmed, BS’01, founder, chairman and CEO of DECA Dental Group. We also announced an endowed scholarship, the Dr. Sulman Ahmed Scholarship Fund, a permanent endowment for the support of students in the Jindal School’s Young Scholars Program, which serves predominantly underrepresented and first-generation students. Our School is known for academic programs that prepare students to utilize quantitative, analytical methods and Information technology tools to solve business problems. In keeping with maintaining our status as innovators at the forefront of technology, we have been busy updating our curricula and developing new programs. As part of these efforts, we held our first annual Cybersecurity Day this semester with a panel of chief information security officers at various corporations and organizations. Our keynote speaker was Ron Mehring, CISO of Texas Health Resource. Another area of significant interest is AI. Over the past year, we have been busy updating our degree programs to address the changes that are taking place in business practice due to the new AI tools that are being rapidly deployed by companies. AI is already transforming the way we work. We are educating our students to have the skills to take on these jobs that are changed or created by AI. This semester we have over 500 Undergraduate and 1600 Masters students enrolled in our Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence degree programs. That is more than 20 percent of our total enrollment. We have also developed and are redeveloping new courses and updating our existing courses to infuse the impact of AI in all of our degree programs such as marketing, finance, supply chain etc. We are also establishing a leadership position in the study and practice of AI in Business Schools. Last spring we hosted the first annual conference “Biz AI Conference: AI Applications in Business Research”. The conference was a big hit with over 150 attendees coming from 67 different universities. AI and related issues are also addressed in other meetings that we organize such as the 16th Annual Project Management Symposium that we offered this summer and 22’nd Conference on Corporate Governance that we held earlier this month. It is safe to say that companies need workers with AI skills in nearly every field and we at the Jindal School are leading the way in preparing our students for those jobs. Our outstanding faculty members have been making news as academic thought leaders. A change in the U.S. Department of Labor’s nationwide overtime rules was inspired by research conducted by Jindal School researchers. The study was conducted by Dr. Umit Gurun, Stan Liebowitz Distinguished Professor of Accounting; Dr. Bugra Ozel, an associate professor of Accounting both of are members of our School; and a fellow researcher from Harvard. The change in the rules will benefit about 4.3 million U.S. workers. Dr. Mike Peng, O.P. Jindal Distinguished Chair and a professor in the Organizations, Strategy and International Management Area, was elected as president of Asia Academy of Management (AAOM). Peng and fellow researchers who happen to be PhD alumni from the Jindal School won a Best Paper award from the International Management Division of the Academy of Management for their work investigating the acquisition strategies of emerging multi-national enterprises from emerging economies. Dr. Hyesook Chung, an assistant professor in the Jindal School’s Organizations, Strategy and International Management Area, received a Best Convention Paper award from the Human Resources Division of the Academy of Management for a study that explores the effects on employees following company mergers and acquisitions. In student news, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) recognized the UT Dallas-JSOM student chapter with a Cum Laude designation. Dr. Monica Brussolo, the faculty advisor, was awarded the INFORMS2024 Chapter Moving Spirit Award. This year our undergraduate program presented its inaugural Undergraduate Student Conference, allowing many to experience an academic conference for the first time while equipping all of them with tools for academic and professional success. As always our students participate in may regional and national competitions and make us proud with many top awards. I am happy to share with you a new program at the Jindal School, Nash Leaders, was launched last spring. This program helps develop leadership qualities in JSOM students. It is named after and is supported by an endowment created by JSOM alumnus Ron Nash, who is a North Texas business leader and recipient of the 2011 UT Dallas Distinguished Alumni Award. He is also a life member of the UT Dallas Executive Board and a member and past chairman of the Jindal School’s Advisory Council. We continue to improve our rankings, solidifying our position among the top public business schools in the nation. In the most recent ranking news, our graduate program in supply chain management maintained its No. 4 ranking in the Gartner Supply Chain University Top 25 among North American universities while our BS in supply chain management and analytics moved up two places to No. 6. U.S. New & World Report ranked our Professional MBA program at No. 8 (tied) among public university programs and No. 13 (tied) overall in its 2024 Best Part-Time MBA Programs. Fortune ranked our Executive MBA program at No. 9 among public programs and No. 16 overall in its Best Executive MBA Programs 2024. It has been a busy semester, but one that has been fruitful and rewarding. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone connected to the Jindal school — students, faculty, alumni, friends and supporters — for your generous support in both your time, talent and gifts. We are truly grateful to you. Nothing we do would be possible without your support. Dr. Hasan Pirkul Dean and Caruth Chair of Management Learn more about Jindal School academic programs.

    "content": "Jindal Home > About the Jindal School of Management > Naveen Jindal Naveen Jindal About Dean’s Message Naveen Jindal Leadership Rankings Outcomes Community Engagement Conferences Competitions Contacts Since Naveen Jindal earned his MBA from UT Dallas in 1992, he has thrived beyond college successes to become a leading industrialist, practiced statesman and driving force for higher education in his home country, India. Named a 2010 UT Dallas Distinguished Alumnus , he targeted support to the School of Management in the largest alumni gift ever given to the University at that time. His gift, together with that of fellow alumni Charles and Nancy Davidson, created a philanthropic package valued, with matching funds, at $45 million. The University of Texas Board of Regents recognized his philanthropy by naming the school the Naveen Jindal School of Management. “My vision and desire,” Jindal said, “is that the [Jindal] School of Management becomes the school of choice for some of the brightest and best individuals who will truly lead us into the next generation, leaders who will truly embrace the global vision and balance the needs of the people with the environment in an ethical and sustainable manner.” In memory of his late father, Naveen Jindal founded and is chancellor of the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in Haryana, India. JGU has eight schools: art and architecture, banking and finance, business, government and public policy, international affairs, journalism and communication, law and liberal arts and humanities. Jindal’s business career has roots in the O.P. Jindal Group, a multibillion-dollar family conglomerate. He serves as chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited , a steel manufacturer that has diversified into cement production, mining, oil and gas and power generation. A national record holder in India for skeet shooting and an adept polo player, Jindal found another passion while at UT Dallas — politics. He served first as Student Government vice president and then president, at the same time earning the Student Leader of the Year Award. Inspired by displays of the U.S. flag on campus, he later successfully challenged India’s Flag Code, which allowed the banner to be put on view only on special occasions. The effort led him to found the Flag Foundation of India and birthed his parliamentary career. He served two five-year terms in the Lok Sabha, Parliament’s lower house. Besides education, his public and private development initiatives have focused on healthcare, infrastructure, women’s empowerment and youth. In 2023, Jindal returned to UT Dallas as one of the university’s most accomplished alumni, noted as a global leader in industry, a statesman in his home country of India, an advocate for human rights and a record-holding sportsman. He was presented with the University’s Lifetime Achievement Award. At the Awards Gala, Jindal said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award renewed his commitment to making a difference in the world. “For me, this award is not just a recognition of my past accomplishments, but a call to action for the future,” Jindal said. “There is still so much work to be done, but I believe we all have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to make the world a better place.”"

How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.

Student Testimonials Thomas Rodgers (EMBA 2022) The Executive MBA program has been a fantastic experience, and the cohort has become more than just a group of students taking a class together- we have become friends that can lean on each other and help our fellow cohort members no matter what. Aside from the incredibly talented faculty and staff, the networking opportunities have been invaluable. I know the connections that I’m making with this cohort will last and benefit my career well into the future. The curriculum has been curated to be relevant and useful for today’s business environment. The academic experience has been challenging and is one of the myriad reasons why I would recommend this program to anyone considering an MBA. Veronica Sanchez, MS LOD I was initially drawn to the Master of Science in Organizational Development program by its reputation for providing deep, practical insights and fostering leadership skills in a collaborative learning environment. The program not only met but surpassed my expectations by delivering rigorous coursework that broadened my understanding and expertise in organizational development. What truly enhanced my experience, however, were the remarkable peers I learned alongside, whose perspectives continually enriched our discussions, as well as the dedicated mentors, professors, and faculty members who invested wholeheartedly in my growth. This journey has been immensely rewarding, and I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to continue to drive success and inspire others. Dan Glasky I was fortunate enough to discover and then enroll in the Product Lifecycle and Supply Chain Management Program at The University of Texas at Dallas. The program was extremely beneficial to me as it tied together the various stages of the product lifecycle with optimal supply chain solutions in order to create value through the chain; a must for anyone working in the CPG industry. Combined with the MBA curriculum, I found the program “connected the dots” specifically in the areas of finance and accounting. I enjoyed being on campus once a month, participating in lectures and working/learning in a highly collaborative environment! Tamer Elshamy, GLEMBA ’19 Sales Director, Fawry Banking and Payment Technology Services An exceptional experience mixed with both cutting edge knowledge and great personal skills improvement. Michelle Miller, EMBA 2015 Research Operations Manager, CBRE The executive coaching experience was very helpful in guiding my understanding of my strengths and weaknesses and helping me build a plan to leverage them or overcome them, respectively. My executive coach and I continued to work together after the structured part of the program was over as my coach’s expertise in career transitions was very helpful as I evaluated, negotiated, and executed my next career move. Erinn Marks, GLEMBA ’19 I searched for an online program that was a WIN-WIN. I was able to pursue my MBA and enjoy the last of the wonder years with my children. Vinay Rao, EMBA 2021 ERP Specialist Advisor NTT Data Services As an engineer, who made decisions mostly based on data, I was most impacted by courses like organizational behavior, c-suite leadership, and performance transformation. I also enjoyed all the finance and economics classes. These topics helped broaden my perception of what I can do for my company and community. David Gill After much engineering and product development experience in the semiconductor/electronic product space, I found this program to be exceptional for enriching my knowledge of the full product lifecycle. The curriculum was well balanced, engaging and formatted so individual benefits from their own studies as well as others’ perspectives through group interaction. The program is not limited to the boundaries of sourcing and purchasing but rather includes the study and tools for management of the complete product lifecycle. I have a much-improved understanding of operational considerations and a complete tool set to utilize because of the PLSCM program. It has greatly increased my contribution and success in executing my responsibilities. Vinesh Reddy Vice President, Business Process Offshore, Bank of America The executive coaching experience was transformational. I was analyzed by my coach and was provided great recommendations to improve myself from where I was before the coaching to where I am now. I found the experience to be valuable to me personally and professionally. Jennifer Masie, EMBA 2022 Vice President, Retail Operations and Chief of Staff I immediately began to apply the skills sets from statistics and economics at work. I can see how the knowledge and confidence has enabled me to be a better contributor overall. Daniel Hendrickson, EMBA 2022 VP, Sr. Financial Analyst, First United Bank The EMBA cohort means being a part of an elite group of individuals with similar drives, intelligence, and upward mobility ambitions. As a member of the cohort, I have benefited from my fellow members’ experience and industry knowledge. The EMBA program is competitive, but the cohort is out for its members’ well-being and improvement. Business Economics has been my favorite class so far. Professor Kiser’s wealth of knowledge is absolutely world-class. Economics is not an easy subject, but he has the ability to take complex concepts and make them easy to understand. I would recommend the UTD EMBA program as they create an environment to focus on your professional development and advance it for decades. The material and classes are fantastic, but the quality of the cohort is even more impressive. Bill Disario I can confidently say that earning my MBA in Supply Chain Management at UT Dallas later in life has strengthened my business knowledge base, even after working for several decades in mid-level operational and supply chain roles. In addition, having a specialized MBA has enabled better promotional and advancement leadership roles as well as higher level compensation opportunities. I would highly recommend this program for anyone looking to take their Supply Chain career path to the next level! Ellie Shollenberger The UT Dallas Product Lifecycle & Supply Chain Management is a unique and one of a kind Executive MBA program; no other school offers this concentration. Unlike the traditional EMBA with a finance focus, this program taught me the importance of making the best business decision beyond the numbers. The knowledge and experience I gained in the program has given me more opportunities to be involved with important projects and to manage corporate programs in the company; and I am enjoying this challenge. Most importantly, I learned a lot from my highly experienced classmates with different backgrounds, and the friendships we built during our international study trip is a lifetime gift and priceless! Alexander Moeller, EMBA 2017 Quality Director, Diodes Inc. Coach Mario helped me transform into a more effective and self-aware leader. Using the syllabus and coaching guide provided by UTD as a basis to conduct our sessions, Mario was always very flexible in adjusting the content of our sessions. He thoughtfully summarized the key topics that we discussed during each session and sent them with action items we had agreed on for the following month. Darrick Fitzgerald, GLEMBA ’18 Managing Consultant – Supply Chain Management Reverse Logistics Team, Verizon Wireless GLEMBA was not just a learning experience, it was a life experience. GLEMBA was not a career pursuit, it was a life pursuit. Even today, tenets from the program impact how I think, how I approach a problem in my career and how I craft my emails. Was I promoted after I finished my degree? Yes. Andrew Svatek, EMBA 2022 Director of Operations, Svatek Consulting When researching EMBA programs to pursue it was clear early on that UTD’s EMBA was the perfect fit for me. The elite faculty, diversity of the program, and relevant and evolving curriculum were huge drivers in my decision and made it a no-brainer. I always anticipated an academic journey that would challenge me personally and professionally, but what I did not anticipate was the unbelievable camaraderie and support of my cohort that was established on the first day of orientation. I have learned as much from my classmates as I have from my professors, and I know I will leave UTD with lifelong friends and a world-class executive education. I am so grateful for the opportunity to earn an EMBA at UTD JSOM Alberto Gutierrez Algren Immediately after graduating, I was able to transition to higher position. I am very certain that without the MBA and PLSCM expertise gained through UTD and this program, I would not have had these opportunities for advancement. Additionally, I was able to utilize that knowledge, to become part of two start-up business opportunities, which I would not have even considered for fear of the unknown before earning my MBA. Tu Huynh The Executive MBA in Product Lifecycle in Supply Chain Management has been a tremendous value for me. The knowledge and insights that I gained from the program have helped me be confident in evaluating new business opportunities and understanding supply chain risks in order to maximize the return on investment on our project portfolio. The Executive MBA in PLSCM improved my ability to make many critical decisions for my role in the Digital Business Transformation Office where I am interfacing with many business partners and suppliers on behalf of Comerica Bank. Jacob Heller, MS LOD The MSLOD program with the Strategic HR concentration gave me the knowledge and confidence to achieve my career goals. The curriculum helped me reframe how I approach business leaders daily to achieve my intended results better. The program provided both breadth and depth of understanding while also giving me the tools to dive deeper and learn more independently when needed. Andy Miller, GLEMBA ’16 IT Operations Manager, Splunk The GLEMBA program’s focus on global business challenges was vital in helping me to understand how my company can grow and succeed in a globally competitive landscape. The courses, interaction with peers and the exceptional faculty have empowered me to analyze and solve problems differently – essentially the program has enabled me to become a better leader.

Living Learning Communities (LLCs) are groups of students who share academic goals and interests and live together in a designated residence hall. Every year, our faculty personally welcomes new freshmen students who move into rooms reserved for the Jindal School of Management (JSOM) Living Learning Community (LLC). LLC freshmen students live suite-style in groups of three; each suite has three private bedrooms and a shared living area. JSOM students live together on the same floor and are all enrolled in a JSOM-specific Professional Development/Communication course, a required freshman course that offers guidance through the early months of college. Our LLC students take part in group activities and typically develop peer relationships more quickly, enjoy increased faculty interaction outside the classroom and maintain higher GPAs. LLC freshmen students also participate in special events, interact closely with faculty and take part in community service projects. In the residence hall, freshmen can seek help from their community adviser. For more information, visit UT Dallas Living Learning Communities . University Commons Residence Halls Furnished three-bedroom suites with common sitting and bathroom areas Accessible by Comet Card Laundry room, mail room, study lounges, community kitchen and music practice room Billiards, ping pong, foosball and large screen TVs Utilities and internet services included Outdoor grills and sports courts Onsite dining hall and recreation center Contact Us Angela Granger JSOM Living Learning Community Advisor Ask a Question | 972-883-5965 | JSOM 11.105H LLC creates a holistic academic environment where learning is not limited to the classroom. Students who are chosen as members of the JSOM LLC reside together as a community within an assigned residence hall. During the fall semester, they will be registered for a special cohort section of the freshman business communication course taught within their hall and take business law together. Living and taking classes together as a group has the additional benefit of providing a team-like feeling within the larger university environment. Study groups and peer tutoring are a common sight during the evenings in the residence hall. We are here to help, so please contact us with any academic questions that you may have about JSOM LLC. For more information about specific courses for LLC participants, you may also contact the JSOM advising office or visit UT Dallas LLC main office . How to Apply for JSOM LLC? To apply for a spot in the JSOM Living Learning Community, the incoming freshman must select this option on their housing application. Participation in JSOM LLC is limited and filled on the basis of first-come, first-served. Currently, our JSOM cohort is limited to 100 students, and normally, there is a waiting list each year. To ensure your place, students must complete their housing application as early as possible. Please visit UT Dallas Living Learning Communities site for more information about this valuable first-year program for JSOM incoming freshmen. For residential life questions, please contact livinglearning@utdallas.edu . Apply for LLC Frequently Asked Questions What is a Living Learning Community? An LLC is a residential cohort program for first-year freshmen who are enrolled in similar academic programs. What advantages does the LLC offer? Participating in an LLC provides a built-in support network for first-year students. LLC students enjoy an easier transition into college life and tend to make friends quickly with students who share common interests and goals. Other advantages include increased faculty and staff contact outside of the classroom through special events throughout the year. How do I apply? To apply, you must complete a housing application . The JSOM LLC has limited spaces and is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. We run a lengthy waitlist each year, so it is recommended that you apply early. What are the requirements to join? You must be an incoming freshman who has been accepted to UT Dallas as a JSOM major. All applicants must live on campus in designated LLC spaces and enroll in the courses required for your community. What if I have been accepted as a pre-business major? Pre-business majors are eligible for the JSOM LLC as long as you have been approved to enroll in JSOM coursework. What classes do LLC students take together? First-semester LLC students will take BCOM 1300 and BLAW 2301 together as a cohort. What are some events I can expect? Events can vary from year to year but typically include a formal dinner with the Dean of JSOM, special advising workshops prior to registration periods, professional networking events and more. Can I request a certain roommate? Yes, as long as they have also been accepted into the JSOM LLC. Requests for non-JSOM LLC roommates cannot be accommodated in the residence halls. How will I know I have been accepted into the LLC? Acceptance emails will be sent to your UT Dallas email account prior to the first freshman orientation session in June. What if I decide to opt out of the LLC? Contact livinglearning@utdallas.edu immediately. Requests to opt out are contingent on space available in other residence halls and are only granted during the summer months prior to the fall semester. Who can I contact with further questions?

Neurodiversity is a concept that regards individuals with differences in brain function and behavioral traits as part of a normal variation in the human population. Neurodiversity describes the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one “right” way of thinking, learning and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits. The word neurodiversity refers to the variety of all people, but it is often used in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as other neurological or developmental conditions such as ADHD or learning disabilities. Events for Neurodiversity at the Jindal School Neurodiversity Celebration Week The Naveen Jindal School of Management is a registered participant in Neurodiversity Celebration Week — as such, students have access to the resources provided by this international network.

Any violation of the policies listed here will result in voiding one’s application. Application Requirements Failure to comply with any of the requirements for any reason (planned or unplanned) results in revocation of the assistantship and associated privileges and benefits, including but not limited to revocation of the in-state tuition (if applicable). All JSOM graduate students applying for an assistantship: MUST review and get familiar with the UTD policies related to graduate assistantship . MUST be in good academic standing and free of any academic dishonesty/affairs record with the Dean of Students ( Office of Student Affairs ). Applicants authorize JSOM to check student records when applying. Please see Community Standards and Conduct for University Policies. .

Apply Now FAQ I am a new incoming student. Can I apply for a TA/RA assistantship? No, you are not eligible. One of the requirements is to have a minimum UTD GPA of 3.400 that you have not earned yet. However, you are welcome to apply for employment the following semester. Can I do an internship and be a TA during the same semester? No. What is the selection process? TA assignments are determined by the hiring program based on the needs of the department and faculty. The hiring departments review all applications and select applicants based on several criteria, including the highest number of credit hours completed, highest GPA earned and academic performance in UTD courses. For example, an applicant who has completed 15 semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA has priority over an applicant who has completed nine semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA. When does my TA/RA assistantship start? You are not a TA/RA until the UTD HR completes all hiring paperwork. Do I get in-state tuition? The out-of-state, non-Texas resident or international students with an F1 visa are eligible for the in-state tuition work for 20 hours per week. When do I get paid? Your salary will be deposited into your account at the end of each month. However, depending on when you completed your hiring paperwork and the cut-off date for the payroll, you may not receive your first paycheck. Instead, you would receive it the following month. This semester, I am a TA/RA. Do I get my assistantship again next semester? No, you must apply online again each semester. The assistantship is not automatically renewed, and prior employment does not guarantee nor warrant any subsequent appointment. This semester, I am a TA/RA, and I got an internship (or a job offer). Can I leave? No. You must not seek an internship and/or a job placement while being a TA/RA. If you leave, the implications on faculty and hundreds of students are significant because you leave them with no support. Also, if you received an in-state tuition, it will be revoked immediately, and you must refund UTD as well. Is my TA/RA employment a binding contract? Yes, your employment is binding. Remember, a government-funded university hires you. What should I do if I have an issue with the faculty? You must meet and discuss any possible issues with the faculty directly. Most often, straightforward communication with the faculty would resolve the issue. Contact the Area Coordinator of the class to which you are assigned if there are unresolved issues with your assigned faculty member. Do I need to attend any TA/RA orientations? Yes, the TA/RA employment requires two specific orientations: 1) UTD Office of Graduate Studies and 2) JSOM graduate office. It is your responsibility to attend both orientations as stated in the requirements. Otherwise, you will be dropped from the assistantship (no exceptions). This also means that you must change your personal travel plans, if any, to ensure you can attend both orientations. Orientations are in-person, and in some situations, they might be online."

Note: all requests should be sent a minimum of two business days before your event. For groups outside JSOM, contact UT Dallas Facilities Management to make an event setup request. Server Frequently Asked Questions Are there research servers available for Faculty and PhD students, and how do I get access to them? Yes, all Faculty and PhD students automatically gain access to all research servers available within the JSOM sandbox. This includes servers hosting a range of commonly used analytics and programming software such as STATA or Python. If you have any questions regarding software availability and corresponding server names, please contact us at JSOMTFS@utdallas.edu . Are there class servers available for students, and how do I reserve server space for classes? Class servers must be reserved at least three weeks prior to the start of the semester. Late requests will still be processed, but the turnover might be delayed if reservations aren’t made ahead of time. We have servers available for SAS, STATA and R for student use. Undergraduate and Graduate students will only have access to these servers for as long as they are enrolled in sections with reservations and will have access revoked once the semester ends. To check server software availability or to reserve space, please email us at JSOMTFS@utdallas.edu . Data is wiped from class servers at the start of every semester, so students are advised to migrate their data off the server via OneDrive or by mounting their local drives to the servers before a remote session. What information do I need to provide to reserve server space for classes? In your email, please include the class number , all section numbers you will be teaching and the number of students who will need server access, as well as any software that is required for the class. Some classes may need to be assigned to labs depending on the workload and software requirements. If you’re unsure about whether to use labs or servers for your class, you can email us at JSOMTFS@utdallas.edu , and we will direct your email to the correct department regarding class servers or lab access. How will I connect to the servers? All our servers currently run on the Windows Server operating system and can be accessed through “Remote Desktop Connection,” which is a remote connection application included in all non-home versions of Windows machines. You can use the “Microsoft Remote Desktop” application available from the App Store on Mac devices to connect to the servers as well. You can also mount your local drives onto the servers before connecting for easy data transfer, or use your OneDrive account. Can I store data on research servers? The research servers are communal and are NOT meant for long-term data storage or the storage of large data sets. All data on communal research servers that haven’t been accessed for 90 days will be permanently deleted, so please move your data to a secure location once you are done processing it. You can mount any local drives, such as your C drive, to the server before connecting through Remote Desktop under “Show Options -> Local Resources -> More” and checking the boxes for drives you want to mount. You can then find these mounted drive locations under “This PC” in File Explorer once you’re on the server. Any data saved on this mounted drive will be saved on your local PC. You can also access the data on your PC through the mounted drive. You can alternatively use your UTD or personal OneDrive or Box profile to easily transfer data to and from the cloud. Where can I store large data sets? If I have large data sets that need to be shared between other faculty, how can I do that? Depending on the amount of data, you can use OneDrive or Box to store your data and share files with other users. You can also email JSOMTFS@utdallas.edu for space on our storage server if you need to store research data, which can be shared with other UTD users. How often are the servers restarted? All servers, including research, class, and personal servers, are restarted on the last Saturday of every month. This is to ensure our servers are properly patched and comply with all security standards. How will I find out about upcoming server outages? A mass email will be sent regarding any outages outside the regularly scheduled patching window. These outages are rare and will usually be for maintenance. There may be emergency outages for critical security vulnerabilities or hardware issues, which you will also be notified of by email if they happen. Can UTD Faculty and Students retain access to research servers or on-site storage after leaving the university? Your access to all servers and storage is revoked automatically upon the date of your departure. Any data you have saved on research servers, class servers and local storage servers will be deleted after 30 days. You can extend your access to server resources by being sponsored by a UTD Faculty member. You must have your sponsor fill out an eCAT for temporary NetID access to campus resources to regain access to JSOM Servers. If you have any questions regarding the extension of NetIDs and post-graduation access to the campus network, please contact OIT at assist@utdallas.edu"

Alumni Spotlight Gaurav Sethi, BS’20 Investment Bank Risk Analyst, JP Morgan Sethi works at JP Morgan as a specialist in counterparty credit risk calculations, doing the heavy analysis that most don’t even know exists – he investigates and explains derivative exposure variances and changes. Sethi earned both finance and actuarial science undergrad degrees. (Actuarial science is in the UT Dallas School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.) Notably, Sethi was awarded the prestigious $15,000 Mitchell Family Foundation Scholar Award from the Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation, based on his work with CampusOven, a service that connects university employees and students with caterers who are focused on healthy eating options. Turning Adversity into Achievement: Abinav Bayya’s Academic Transformation Abinav Bayya came to the Naveen Jindal School of Management to pursue his Master of Science in Supply Chain Management. After a turbulent first semester, Bayya found himself on academic probation. Lester Dsouza, Class of ’21 Financial Analyst at CBRE During my research for a good graduate school, I saw that the MS in Finance at JSOM offered more than just quality education, it provided an access to huge knowledge pool and experience from the faculties and the peers alike. It had the widely diverse class with students from all around the world to learn from, while having 200+ student organizations to develop myself outside of the classroom and make friends. Being located really close to Dallas, a major city which has great opportunities also influenced my decision to enroll at JSOM. Long Ly, Class of ’21 Investment Analyst at Invitation Homes The experience was wonderful, learning from the JSOM professors has shaped me personally and professionally. The JSOM students there were also very intellectual and curious. It was a great educational experience. Andrew Joseph Limas, BS’19 Assistant Language Teacher, RCS Japan After graduating from Jindal School with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Limas signed up with RCS Corporation Japan, a staffing company based in Tokyo that finds English teachers for local schools. The company placed him in a job in Tokyo, where Limas now works as an assistant language teacher. In his role, he shares language skills with his students along with information about American culture and traditions. He credits opportunities to work on start-up business ideas at the Jindal School with expanding his understanding about how businesses work. Ian Martinez, Class of ’21 DVC informatics Analyst at Houlihan Lokey I chose my MS degree in Finance at JSOM primarily because of the curriculum and the faculty staff. The courses taught covered all of the areas in finance and it gave the opportunity to specialize in different concentrations, such as financial technology or investment analysis. Additionally, the faculty is very well prepared and up to date in the latest research. Abhishek Sharma, Class of ’21 Finance Manager at Amazon My background experience was a mix of technical qualifications as a software engineer and work experience as a futures trader and Sales Finance Manager. Even though I had worked in the finance domain in different capacities, I didn’t have experience of academic finance and when looking for options for my graduate level education my priority was to complement both my previous education and work experience. The MS Finance program at JSOM not only fulfilled all the criteria but also boasted of world class faculty and a very enhanced learning program and facilities.

Promote behavioral research that complements quantitative research Most important strides in behavioral research have resulted from a focus on testing quantitative models or from using behavioral findings to fashion new quantitative models. The center builds on UTD’s strength in a quantitative approach to research targeted to top journals. Maintain a computer laboratory devoted to experimental testing The laboratory environment is controlled and can maintain conditions that are conducive to exploring new ideas and concepts. The lab is open to use by researchers across the Jindal School of Management and beyond. Innovation for learning excellence The CLBOE actively promotes the transition of software and related tools from behavioral research to interactive learning tools for the classroom. The lab also provides research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students through collaborative efforts with research faculty. Resources for growth The CLBOE promotes grant proposals to national agencies such as the National Science Foundation and private agencies such as the Russell Sage Foundation. Outreach and interaction with the business community An important trend in behavior research is the establishment of methods to translate basic research findings into applied science. CBLOE actively promotes connections with the Dallas business community. Members & Collaborators Faculty Members Name Position/Title Gary E.

The Center’s focus is to connect UTD with various parties involved in the evolution of financial markets and institutions. The economics of operating in virtually all industries continue to change with digitalization. Communication costs, computation costs, transaction costs and management costs have dropped dramatically in the last fifteen years. At the same time, some risks, such as achieving cybersecurity or achieving a successful restructuring, have increased. The new capabilities of disruptive technologies of the last decade (blockchain and artificial intelligence, for example) have also reinforced pressures to innovate. The Center’s initiatives are to help the various parties interested in or involved in financial innovation to connect with one another, and grow as a result. The Center was co-founded in 2009 by Dr. David Springate and Elizabeth Jones within the disciplines of applied finance and value creation.

Nationally, healthcare spending is approaching $4 trillion, representing almost 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. In the North Texas region alone, healthcare spending is estimated at $52 billion. Hospitals, clinics, research, ambulatory care, post-acute care and fiscal intermediaries are all part of this. As a growing industry, healthcare demands a more purposeful and integrated approach to workforce preparation and education. North Texas hospitals and hospital systems are large employers, creating over 240,000 jobs and injecting billions of dollars into the economy through employee salaries, retail sales and sales taxes. Hospitals provide jobs for an immense range of skill levels with opportunities for upward mobility in the profession. About Us The Center for Leadership and Management’s Role in the Growing Healthcare Sector The healthcare industry is increasingly complex and demands a well-prepared workforce. The Naveen Jindal School of Management plays a unique role in training the next generation of healthcare leaders to meet local, regional and national demands. Unlike other educational institutions that provide education predominantly through clinical or allied health professional programs, the Jindal School of Management utilizes its strengths in accounting, administration, finance, marketing and information systems to educate highly qualified personnel. Mission The mission of the Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management (CHLM) at the Jindal School of Management is to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing, technology-driven healthcare industry by: Conducting research that enhances management knowledge Delivering high-quality leadership and management education to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students and practicing executives and physicians Developing, innovating and continuously improving programs that advance leadership and management education and practices Vision The Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management will: Become the definitive resource for healthcare leadership and management education in North Texas Facilitate collaboration among the school’s five academic programs Offer industry-responsive education that will prepare industry-ready students Become nationally recognized for academic/industry collaboration and integration Academics and Certificates Preparing The Next Generation Of Healthcare Leaders The Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management (CHLM) serves as an influential and respected resource for healthcare management education. The CHLM coordinates and synchronizes the school’s five healthcare management academic programs. BS in Healthcare Management The program provides a foundation in the healthcare field while teaching business acumen that produces industry-ready graduates for entry-level management positions. MS in Healthcare Leadership and Management The program provides graduate-level education to prepare industry leaders with a solid foundation in business analysis and exposure to real-world healthcare management. Executive MS/MBA in Healthcare Leadership and Management (for physicians) This cohort program provides critical knowledge, skills and academic credentials for physicians who have moved into a leadership role in their hospital, health system, group practice or professional organization. Executive MS in Healthcare Leadership and Management (for professionals) This new graduate program provides healthcare professionals with five or more years of healthcare or similar industry experience with insights and tools needed to emerge as healthcare leaders, developing the necessary skills to master strategic planning and executive leadership roles in any organization. Organizationally-tailored MS and EMBA Degree Programs for Healthcare Organizations Since 2011, the Organizational Behavior and Coaching Program has partnered with major healthcare systems to offer cohort-based, organization-specific degree programs. Read More Specifically, large healthcare organizations are able to sponsor an Executive MBA or MS degree program in healthcare organization leadership that is customized to fit the unique needs and issues specific to their organization. For instance, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Texas Health Resources, and Parkland Health and Hospital System have sponsored such a program to provide a formal business education as well as leadership development to their leaders and high-potential employees. Cohorts are hand-selected by the senior leadership of the organization from a list of applicants, who are then invited to attend this elite program. To accommodate the demanding schedules of these busy professionals, classes are delivered using a blended learning approach that combines on-site intensives with online learning technology. This blended delivery model guarantees both quality and convenience. To ensure organizational relevance, the subject matter taught in both degree programs draws from illustrations and case studies specific to the sponsoring organization. At UT Southwestern Medical Center, for example, the knowledge and skills needed to measure and improve the quality of both clinical and patient service processes are taught using UT Southwestern data and quality initiatives. Senior leaders within the organization join the teaching faculty within their area of specialty to provide an organizationally relevant context for all subjects during on-site intensives. Prior to graduating, students are required to participate in capstone projects to utilize what they have learned during their degree program to solve actual organizational problems or issues deemed important by the senior management team who initially selected the students. Finally, students are assigned executive coaches to help them develop as professionals and apply what is being taught to their specific work situations. Coupled with a graduate-level education, organizationally-relevant application and an integrated executive coaching component, graduates are able to make a value-added contribution to their sponsoring organization while enhancing their educational credentials. Robert Hicks, PhD Director, Organizational Behavior and Executive Coaching Program robert.hicks@utdallas.edu | (972)-883-5900 | JSOM 1.920 Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management Development The Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management’s growth is assured through coordination and collaboration among the Jindal School’s existing healthcare programs.

The center will conduct business research, host executive training on Fintech and Digital Asset Management and investigate phenomena of interest across all members of the financial technologies ecosystem. The center works in collaboration with industry, policymakers and academia and has close ties with the local business community. Vision In the year 2030, the Jindal School is a global research leader in the management of Financial and Digital Asset Technologies. Financial and Digital Asset Technologies will reshape financial services and digital asset management over the next two decades. The emergence of new financial services, digital asset management and the corresponding digital economy will be the most significant and disruptive trends. Our vision for the center is the creation of applied knowledge to manage financial and digital asset technologies. Besides creating significant value for end-consumers, financial and digital asset technologies will impact financial institutions (e.g., banks), capital markets and regulatory bodies. Data will become a key asset for individuals and institutions. We will see the disintermediation of traditional intermediaries (such as banks and stock exchanges) by nimble Fintechs that will be service-oriented rather than the supply-driven model of traditional financial companies. This reintermediation will deliver more value at higher efficiency by exploiting new information technologies (such as blockchain, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning and others). A key competitive advantage of future financial services firms will be their ability to manage and monetize data as assets. There will be a shift in the core business models of firms in this sector from financial arbitrage to information arbitrage. Financial and Digital Asset technologies will rapidly change how financial data is disseminated, processed, analyzed and traded. The innovation will be radical and fundamental. It will disrupt the modes of financial payment, funding, lending, investing, trading, financial services and ultimately the speed of financial transactions. Mission We respond to managerial challenges and opportunities in the job market created by Fintech and Digital Asset Management. The FD-Tech Center leverages, combines and restructures existing resources to enhance student education and experience, create industry collaboration and deliver targeted executive programs in this area. Advancing Fintech and digital asset research is the center’s key mission. We plan to create a new research focus and identity for the Jindal School and increase the research output of the school by fostering interdisciplinary research collaborations across departments and with industry partners. The explosive development of technology and data-driven business models creates unique managerial opportunities and challenges for the digital transformation of the finance industry. We will conduct cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research involving all business school disciplines. We will provide students with the necessary skills and updated knowledge to navigate the competition in the market and facilitate business transformation and growth (e.g., blockchain associates, technology advisors, digital asset managers, Fintech specialists, etc.). We will provide customized executive training to respond to the special needs of companies transitioning to adopting new Fintech and digital asset models.

The center supports research and educational programs related to new products and the management of established products. Marketing is the key to new product success. Whether a company is in a dynamic, high-technology industry, an industry reshaped by deregulation or an industry faced with increased competition, it must first understand customer needs. Yet a gap often exists between a company’s engineering and R&D skills and its marketing capability. To help close this gap, the center carries out activities aimed at coordinating the functions of technology and marketing. There is no such thing as national advertising. All advertising is local and personal. It’s one man or woman reading one newspaper in the kitchen or watching TV in the den. – Morris Hite Product Development and Marketing Science The Morris Hite Center was established to encourage research in marketing science and product development. Areas of research include topics in internet marketing, customer relationship management, product creation and sales forecasting.

    "content": "Research Rankings Overview The UT Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management has created a database to track publications in 24 leading business journals. The database contains titles and author affiliations of papers published in these journals since 1990. The information in the database is used to provide the top 100 business school rankings since 1990 based on the total contributions of faculty. Additionally, the database can also be searched by: Any journal or combination of journals between the time period 1990 to date to get a ranking of schools School name to see a list of publications by a school for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date Author name to see a list of publications by an author for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date Key phrase in article name to see a list of publications containing that phrase for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date The Jindal School of Management maintains and keeps this website current to provide timely data on research productivity in leading research journals across major disciplines in business schools. The school has worked hard to ensure data integrity, but as with any project of this type where the affiliation data is not always clear, some errors may exist. If you spot an error, please send us the corrections at Top 100 Admin . List of Journals The Accounting Review Since : 1990 Journal of Accounting and Economics Since : 1990 Journal of Accounting Research Since : 1990 Journal of Finance Since : 1990 Journal of Financial Economics Since : 1990 The Review of Financial Studies Since : 1990 Information Systems Research Since : 1990 Journal on Computing Since : 1990 MIS Quarterly Since : 1990 Journal of Consumer Research Since : 1990 Journal of Marketing Since : 1990 Journal of Marketing Research Since : 1990 Marketing Science Since : 1990 Management Science Since : 1990 Operations Research Since : 1990 Journal of Operations Management Since : 1990 Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Since : 1999 Production and Operations Management Since : 1992 Academy of Management Journal Since : 1990 Academy of Management Review Since : 1990 Administrative Science Quarterly Since : 1990 Organization Science Since : 1990 Journal of International Business Studies Since : 1990 Strategic Management Journal Since : 1990 Methodology UT Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management provides a tool to study research articles/notes published in 24 leading journals in major business disciplines. The database contains author and their affiliation information on all research articles/notes published in these journals since 1990. Authors’ affiliations are recorded at the time of the publication. A single-authored research article/note results in the school of affiliation being credited with a score of 1. If there are multiple authors from different schools, each school gets a score of p/n, where p is the number of authors from the same school and there are a total of n authors on the article. If an author lists multiple affiliations, each of the school that author is affiliated with gets a corresponding scaled score. For example, if one of the n authors lists m affiliations, each school that author is affiliated with gets a score of 1/nm. The database can be searched by any period between 1990 to the current year for any combination of journals, resulting in aggregated scores for schools. This provides a clear picture of contributions from each school for the selected journals and the time period. The database can also be searched by school names, author names and key phrases in the article’s title. The Jindal School of Management also provides a ranking of the top 100 schools in North America and Worldwide based on published research articles/notes in all 24 journals for the last five-year time period. The school also provides links to prior rankings starting with the period 2000-2004. 15th June, 2017 Update The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings methodology has been amended effective 15th June 2017. The modification affects business schools whose authors have listed affiliations with either the National Bureau of Economic Research and/or the Centre for Economic Policy Research along with their university affiliations. The new methodology assigns full credit to the author’s university affiliation when computing the rankings (in the prior rankings each affiliation received 1/n where n was the number of affiliations the author listed). This change will be reflected only in the rankings going forward and the prior published rankings have not been amended. 18th March, 2020 Update The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings methodology has been amended effective 18th March 2020. The modification affects refereed articles in the Journal of International Business Studies . Prior to March 18, 2020, only articles published in the Original Paper category were included in the rankings. Now refereed articles from the other categories are also included in the rankings. This change is reflected in the current rankings and in rankings generated as a result of queries posed within Rankings by Journal. Disclaimer Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information, the nature and diversity in which author affiliation information is provided in the journals sometimes make it hard to categorize and report the information accurately. UT Dallas’ Jindal School of Management has attempted to verify information using the web when possible. While searching for articles, author names are provided in the search results. They are not listed in the sequence specified in the published paper. Also note that when information on authors is provided, if the same author is listed twice, it indicates that the author has listed multiple affiliations. If you believe there is an error in the information provided, please send specific information to the administrator. The Naveen Jindal School of Management appreciates your input to this ongoing research effort. Sincerely, Naveen Jindal School of Management"

Alumni Testimonials Haibin Yang Professor in Strategic Management, College of Business, City University of Hong Kong When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards Bharadwaj Kadiyala Assistant Professor, Eccles School of Business, University of Utah The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students. The faculty are extremely enthusiastic about identifying and rigorously addressing interesting research problems. I feel lucky to have been a part of that environment during my PhD and it is through my interactions with the faculty that I have been able to develop my own academic research agenda. Oktay Urcan Associate Professor of Accountancy and Fred & Virginia Roedgers Faculty Fellow Gies College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign PhD education at Jindal School of Management transformed me from an undergraduate student who never heard of accounting research to an accounting researcher and teacher at world renowned academic institutions. All credit goes to the faculty members and especially my advisors who patiently invested their valuable time in my PhD training. I enjoyed all moments we shared together as student-mentor, co-authors, colleagues and friends. Harish Guda Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience. Hasan Cavusoglu Professor of Management Information Systems Sauder School of Business, The University of British Columbia Beyond their remarkable intellect, the faculty members at the Jindal School of Management impressed me with their passion for excellence in research, dedication to superb doctoral education and endless patience toward PhD students during my time in the program. They are truly a source of inspiration. I consider myself privileged to have been trained by incredible professors who showed us how to achieve rigor and relevance in research. Subodha Kumar Distinguished Fellow of the Information Systems Society, INFORMS Paul R. Anderson Distinguished Chair Professor, Marketing and Supply Chain Management, Fox School of Business, Temple University The PhD program at the Jindal School of Management prepared me for a successful career in academia. During my doctoral studies, I was fortunate to interact with brilliant professors from different disciplines. They helped me understand how to conduct high-impact research, and mentored me on how to effectively teach. I feel very privileged to have earned my PhD at the Jindal School of Management. Wei Chen Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations, School of Business, University of Kansas When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful. Tai-Yuan Chen Alumni Professor of Finance, HKUST Business School, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology The PhD program at UTD offered solid and life-altering training to students. Faculty members are well-known experts in their own field and most importantly, they are always available whenever students need advice.

Steve Sauerwald Associate Professor, Department of Managerial Studies, College of Business, University of Illinois at Chicago In addition to providing outstanding doctoral training, the faculty helped me to identify high impact research areas and provided incredible mentorship to bring those projects to fruition.

I was analyzed by my coach and was provided great recommendations to improve myself from where I was before the coaching to where I am now. I found the experience to be valuable to me personally and professionally. Andrew Svatek, EMBA 2022 Director of Operations, Svatek Consulting When researching EMBA programs to pursue it was clear early on that UTD’s EMBA was the perfect fit for me. The elite faculty, diversity of the program, and relevant and evolving curriculum were huge drivers in my decision and made it a no-brainer. I always anticipated an academic journey that would challenge me personally and professionally, but what I did not anticipate was the unbelievable camaraderie and support of my cohort that was established on the first day of orientation. I have learned as much from my classmates as I have from my professors, and I know I will leave UTD with lifelong friends and a world-class executive education. I am so grateful for the opportunity to earn an EMBA at UTD JSOM Megan Lightfoot Metzger, MS LOD As a business owner and consultant, I sought to expand my knowledge to foster the growth of both my own businesses and my clients’ ventures. For years, I thought an MBA was the natural next step, but discovering the MS in Leadership and Organizational Development (MSLOD) program felt like finding the perfect fit. Each course offered immediate, actionable insights that I could implement to enhance my businesses and support my clients. The faculty at UT Dallas brings a wealth of expertise and real-world experience to every lesson, but what truly sets them apart is their genuine commitment to each student. Professors were always open to discussing the coursework and went beyond by offering invaluable advice tailored to my unique challenges and goals. My time at UT Dallas has made me a more effective consultant and a better person, and I’m deeply grateful for the profound impact of their mentorship and guidance. Erinn Marks, GLEMBA ’19 I searched for an online program that was a WIN-WIN. I was able to pursue my MBA and enjoy the last of the wonder years with my children. Mohammed Omer, GLEMBA ’19 It’s about the experiences of exchanging skill sets and perspectives. Khaled Hallak, EMBA 2021 Bank of America, Officer, Syndicated Loan Closer I joined the EMBA program at UT Dallas with aspirations to hone my business acumen and skillsets gathered from academia and real-world experience through both entrepreneurship and large corporate ventures. The EMBA program did not polish my current understanding; they shattered my foundation and rebuilt my business knowledge with the most cutting-edge academics through a prestigious curriculum and world-renowned professors. Throughout the rigors of this program, I quickly learned the importance and power of my cohort. With an ocean of information flowing towards you, it is impossible for one person to absorb and process on their own. I formed a tight bond with some of the brightest executive minds across an array of industries. In this program, we did more than just dissect and examine case studies from historic events; we were able to consult with real corporations in efforts to aid with ongoing and current issues. Our impact was evidenced when select corporations successfully implemented our recommendations. This program is far from easy, it will push you to new heights and you will need to reintroduce yourself to your family and friends upon graduation. On the bright side, the leaders of this program, Pamela Brady (Program Director) and Connie Imhof (Program Manager), are such genuine and caring people, you will feel like a part of a new family throughout the duration of this program. If you are looking to expand your knowledge and grow your network, the EMBA at UTD comes highly recommended. Vinay Rao, EMBA 2021 ERP Specialist Advisor NTT Data Services As an engineer, who made decisions mostly based on data, I was most impacted by courses like organizational behavior, c-suite leadership, and performance transformation. I also enjoyed all the finance and economics classes. These topics helped broaden my perception of what I can do for my company and community. Ellie Shollenberger The UT Dallas Product Lifecycle & Supply Chain Management is a unique and one of a kind Executive MBA program; no other school offers this concentration. Unlike the traditional EMBA with a finance focus, this program taught me the importance of making the best business decision beyond the numbers. The knowledge and experience I gained in the program has given me more opportunities to be involved with important projects and to manage corporate programs in the company; and I am enjoying this challenge. Most importantly, I learned a lot from my highly experienced classmates with different backgrounds, and the friendships we built during our international study trip is a lifetime gift and priceless! Ashwin Prakash, GLEMBA ’20 Head of Data Science and Analytics, HCA Healthcare The application of learnings from Operations Management and Strategic Management courses helped make an immediate impact in my job, merging the lines between school and work while providing an instant return on investment for my employer. Jennifer Masie, EMBA 2022 Vice President, Retail Operations and Chief of Staff I immediately began to apply the skills sets from statistics and economics at work. I can see how the knowledge and confidence has enabled me to be a better contributor overall. Bill Disario I can confidently say that earning my MBA in Supply Chain Management at UT Dallas later in life has strengthened my business knowledge base, even after working for several decades in mid-level operational and supply chain roles. In addition, having a specialized MBA has enabled better promotional and advancement leadership roles as well as higher level compensation opportunities. I would highly recommend this program for anyone looking to take their Supply Chain career path to the next level! Jacob Heller, MS LOD The MSLOD program with the Strategic HR concentration gave me the knowledge and confidence to achieve my career goals. The curriculum helped me reframe how I approach business leaders daily to achieve my intended results better. The program provided both breadth and depth of understanding while also giving me the tools to dive deeper and learn more independently when needed. Qiana Levy UTDs EMBA program has surpassed my expectations. The program allowed me to maintain a demanding work schedule alongside a rigorous course load. The caliber of the professors and students, and the alignment of the course materials was exceptional. The program was well-designed and added immense value to my professional growth. Immeasurable components included the executive projects, international trip, collaboration and rich discussions with like-minded professionals. The curriculum enriched my business acumen, strategic foresight/execution, relationship-building and change management skills, as well as created enduring friendships. I am deeply appreciative and highly recommend UTDs EMBA program. Alexander Moeller, EMBA 2017 Quality Director, Diodes Inc. Coach Mario helped me transform into a more effective and self-aware leader. Using the syllabus and coaching guide provided by UTD as a basis to conduct our sessions, Mario was always very flexible in adjusting the content of our sessions. He thoughtfully summarized the key topics that we discussed during each session and sent them with action items we had agreed on for the following month. David Gill After much engineering and product development experience in the semiconductor/electronic product space, I found this program to be exceptional for enriching my knowledge of the full product lifecycle. The curriculum was well balanced, engaging and formatted so individual benefits from their own studies as well as others’ perspectives through group interaction. The program is not limited to the boundaries of sourcing and purchasing but rather includes the study and tools for management of the complete product lifecycle. I have a much-improved understanding of operational considerations and a complete tool set to utilize because of the PLSCM program. It has greatly increased my contribution and success in executing my responsibilities. Tamer Elshamy, GLEMBA ’19 Sales Director, Fawry Banking and Payment Technology Services An exceptional experience mixed with both cutting edge knowledge and great personal skills improvement. Thomas Rodgers (EMBA 2022) The Executive MBA program has been a fantastic experience, and the cohort has become more than just a group of students taking a class together- we have become friends that can lean on each other and help our fellow cohort members no matter what. Aside from the incredibly talented faculty and staff, the networking opportunities have been invaluable. I know the connections that I’m making with this cohort will last and benefit my career well into the future. The curriculum has been curated to be relevant and useful for today’s business environment. The academic experience has been challenging and is one of the myriad reasons why I would recommend this program to anyone considering an MBA. Sean Seabrook, MS LOD The UTD MS in Leadership and Organizational Development is a transformative experience. The coaching certificate provides leading industry training for coaching and the ICF exam, and the organizational consulting certificate gave me practical tools and resources to develop a consulting practice. The MS degree gave me the knowledge to grow as leader and drive change in today’s fast-moving business environment. Professors in the program have corporate backgrounds, bridging academic theory with practical application, and the program is accredited in a business school which also enhances its value and the learning experience. The program expanded my network and I’ve made some life-long friends along the way. The value and experience is outstanding! Curtis Clark My experience during the Supply Chain EMBA program was very rewarding, both professionally and personally. I experienced a terrific camaraderie with my fellow classmates who shared a desire to learn. Dr. Rajamani has a passion for what he teaches and for helping students realize the difference they can make in the workplace. With students from many different industries and cultural backgrounds, I was able to broaden my perspective on the global nature of supply chains. I made this investment in myself. Veronica Sanchez, MS LOD I was initially drawn to the Master of Science in Organizational Development program by its reputation for providing deep, practical insights and fostering leadership skills in a collaborative learning environment. The program not only met but surpassed my expectations by delivering rigorous coursework that broadened my understanding and expertise in organizational development. What truly enhanced my experience, however, were the remarkable peers I learned alongside, whose perspectives continually enriched our discussions, as well as the dedicated mentors, professors, and faculty members who invested wholeheartedly in my growth. This journey has been immensely rewarding, and I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to continue to drive success and inspire others.

Additionally, the faculty is very well prepared and up to date in the latest research. Abhishek Sharma, Class of ’21 Finance Manager at Amazon My background experience was a mix of technical qualifications as a software engineer and work experience as a futures trader and Sales Finance Manager. Even though I had worked in the finance domain in different capacities, I didn’t have experience of academic finance and when looking for options for my graduate level education my priority was to complement both my previous education and work experience.
